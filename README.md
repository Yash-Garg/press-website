### https://press.wtf

Landing page for [press](https://github.com/saket/press) written using [zola](https://getzola.org).

Feel free to use this for your own app's website. This theme was written by a CSS noob so things may not be perfect. I wrote my own theme because I couldn't find anything remotely good looking despite searching for weeks. 

### Usage
```shell
git clone git@github.com:saket/press-website.git && cd press-website
brew install zola
zola serve
```
